=======================================
System requirements
=======================================

Amiko Pay uses the following libraries:
* POSIX sockets (available on all modern UNIX/Linux operating systems)
* OpenSSL ("libssl")
* liburiparser

Amiko Pay is developed on Linux, but it will probably work on all UNIX-like
systems, and you might be able to compile it for windows too. As an example,
you will need the following packages in Ubuntu 12.04:
* build-essential
* libssl-dev
* liburiparser-dev


=======================================
Build instructions
=======================================

Open a terminal, and go to the directory that contains this file.
Then, enter the command "make" and press Enter.
If there were no errors, the executable file "amikopay" has been created.
That's it!

If you encountered errors when building, they are probably related to how
Amiko Pay tries to use the programming libraries: this can be dependent on your
operating system. You can change the settings in the file "Makefile" and retry
building.


=======================================
Installation instructions
=======================================

There is no "standard" way of installing Amiko Pay. You can choose for yourself
where you want to place the executable file.
