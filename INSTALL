=======================================
System requirements
=======================================

The Python prototype of Amiko Pay is developed with Python 2.7.
It is recommended to use Python 2.7 to run Amiko Pay. Other versions might
also work (especially other 2.x versions), but this has not been tested.

In addition, Amiko Pay uses several functions from the OpenSSL library.
Amiko Pay attempts to load these functions from the shared library file
"libssl.so". This is a common name of OpenSSL on Linux; on other systems,
you may beed to change the code a bit; e.g. on windows, the library will
probably have a .dll extension.

For access to the Bitcoin network, Amiko Pay uses the RPC interface of Bitcoin
Core. You should either use the bitcoind program, or the Qt version with the
"-server" commandline option, or any compatible program, to provide this
interface. Bitcoin Core version 0.9 or later is recommended; very old versions
are likely to fail.


=======================================
Installation instructions
=======================================

There is no "standard" way of installing Amiko Pay. At this moment, the
recommended way of using Amiko Pay is to run it directly from its source code
directory.
