<h1>Amiko Pay</h1>
<h3>What is it?</h3>
A de-centralized network for fast, secure, cheap and privacy-friendly
off-blockchain Bitcoin transactions.

<h3>Why Bitcoin?</h3>
There is a long-term trend in society to replace cash with electronic
payment systems. The advantages are obvious: electronic money can be
better protected against robberies and it doesn't need costly and risky
physical transport.
<p>
However, the current methods of electronic payments depend on large,
centralized institutions like banks and credit card companies. This
dependency gives these entities a lot of power, allowing them to demand
customers and merchants to comply with rules that are not in the
interest of those customers and merchants. This is worsened by the fact
that those centralized institutions are easy targets for government
regulation, allowing the government to impose even more rules and
limitations. Also, because of differences and conflicts between
countries, regulations tend to be such that existing electronic payment
methods can not be provided in all countries simultaneously.
<p>
The reason why existing electronic payment systems depend on centralized
insititutions is a fundamental problem with electronic money:
digital information can be copied so easily. If a certain piece of information
represents a certain amount of money, then, by copying that information, the
money can be spent multiple times. Allowing this to happen would lead to
hyper-inflation; this is the essence of the "double spending" problem.
In traditional systems, this problem is avoided to some degree by letting some
central "trusted" regulator place limits on what people can do.
<p>
Bitcoin solves the double-spending problem without a central regulator by
de-centralizing the regulation: there is one public ledger (called the
"block chain"), and every Bitcoin participant can verify the correctness
of that ledger. There is a process called "mining", which is in essence
a de-centralized form of "voting", to reach consensus about which
transactions happened and which did not.
<p>
The result is that Bitcoin allows us to have the same freedom with electronic
payments as we have with cash.

<h3>Why off-blockchain transactions?</h3>
Bitcoin's "block chain" is a global ledger, which is shared among all
Bitcoin users. If all people in the world started to include all their
daily transactions into the block chain, then the block chain would
become so large that, at today's level of technology, almost no users
would choose to download, store and verify the entire block chain.
This would also increase the cost of setting up a miner.
<p>
While it is no problem if a part of Bitcoin users chooses not to verify
the block chain (for instance for use of low-capacity devices like smart
phones), it becomes a problem when the fraction of verifying users becomes
really small. If the large majority of economical power (merchants,
consumers) decides to trust a small group of miners on their word without
verifying the block chain, this puts a large amount of power in the
hands of that group of miners. This centralization of power undoes all
advantages offered by Bitcoin, so it has to be prevented.
<p>
If people choose to keep most of their transactions outside the block
chain, then the block chain can remain small and easily verifiable.
This allows Bitcoin to remain decentralized at the current level of
technology.
<p>
For the people who choose to perform transactions off-blockchain, there
can be immediate benefits as well: since "mining fees" are avoided,
off-blockchain transactions can be cheaper; since the slow de-centralized
consensus process of mining is avoided, transactions can be faster, and
since transactions are not entered in the publicly shared block chain,
privacy can be improved.

<h3>Why Amiko Pay?</h3>
Unlike some other off-blockchain solutions, Amiko Pay offers a solution
that is both secure and de-centralized; this way, all of the advantages
of using Bitcoin are preserved. Amiko Pay is designed to protect
privacy, and the privacy features also help keep the Amiko network open
for new participants.
<p>
Amiko Pay is completely open source, and provides an open platform, on
top of which other people can develop new innovative services.

<h3>How does it work?</h3>
Amiko Pay forms a network between users and payment providers, just like the
Internet forms a network between users and Internet providers. And,
just like the Internet, all providers deliver the same connectivity
(to websites vs. to merchants/customers), so large providers do not
have connectivity advantages over small providers.
<p>
Links between Amiko Pay nodes are protected by
<a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Contracts#Example_7:_Rapidly-adjusted_.28micro.29payments_to_a_pre-determined_party" target="_blank">
micro-payment channels</a>; as a result, only a very low amount of trust
is required to securely establish a link with a payment provider.
This should remove the need for regulation, and it should allow people
to have a large choice of suitable payment providers; even a small,
unknown payment provider on a different continent can be a suitable
option. This should allow plenty of competition, leading to lots of
freedom and low prices.

<h3>Where can I get it?</h3>
Amiko Pay is unfinished software, and since development is currently
not funded, the availability of development time is never guaranteed.
At the current pace of development, it might take a couple of years
before Amiko Pay becomes useful.
